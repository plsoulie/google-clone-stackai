Instructions for using the PNG logo:

1. Save the StackAI Search logo PNG from the conversation to:
   frontend/public/stackai-search-logo.png

2. The logo file should replace the temporary file that was created.

This is necessary because as an AI assistant, I cannot directly save binary PNG data 
from the message to the filesystem. 

The PNG logo shows a black StackAI Search logo with a geometric hexagon-based icon 
on the left and the "StackAI Search" text on the right.
